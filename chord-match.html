          <h2>About this tool</h2>

          <p>
            This tool will play a chord, then a rest, repeated. You should match
            the chord on your instrument.
          </p>
          <p>
            I suggest this tool to be used after mastering chord recognition
            recognition at a slow, flexible speed. A good tool for this is the
            Chord Functions exercise in the
            <a href="https://github.com/ShacharHarshuv/open-ear">
              OpenEar app </a
            >. Also, you should probably also be pretty fast with the companion
            <a href="pitch-match.html"> Pitch Match</a> tool before using this
            one.
          </p>
          <p>
            This tool does not detect whether or not you match pitches
            successfully, you need to have sufficient ear training skill to tell
            for yourself whether or not you match. The main purpose of this tool
            is to (1) push your recognition speed faster, and (2) practice
            matching using your instrument of choice instead of an ear training
            app UI.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may want to try to match notes and voicings exactly, or you may
            want to merely match chord bass, root, and quality. Or whatever. Use
            this tool in any way that helps you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Configure chords by writing their offsets in semitones from the root
            note. Offset lists are written in JSON format, and should just be a
            list of numbers, like
            <code>[0,4,7]</code>. Offsets may be negative, and do not need to be
            in any particular order.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each chord type has a weight for each solfege syllable. If you have
            a major chord with weight 10 on do, and other weights adding up to
            100, then there is a 1/10 chance of the tool playing a major I
            chord. The probability for each chord is unaffected by previous
            chords, unlike the tone match tool.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to add an inverted chord, write the offsets from the
            bass note, and write probabilities based on the bass note. For
            example, a I chord in first inversion would have offsets
            <code>[0,3,8]</code> and be on bass note mi.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also use the arpeggiate mode, note, and rest duration
            parameters to make a “chunked” version of pitch matching. You can do
            this with arpeggios of actual chords, or you can create presets that
            include “chords” that are actually scale fragments or other patterns
            that you want to practice recognizing as a “chunk”. This idea is
            similar to chucking word fragments, words, and common phrases in
            natural language for speaking, listening, or reading. If you can
            recognize a group of notes as a single “chunk”, it can be easier to
            recognize and remember larger musical phrases. Along with increasing
            recognition (and production) speed, chunking can help improve
            musical fluency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each of these tools has a configuration import/export feature to
            save your configuration (and presets) in JSON, as well as edit them
            by hand. To import a saved configuration, paste it into the box and
            use the Import Config button. Press the Export Config button to
            replace the text in the box with the current configuration. Use
            Control+A to select all of the text, copy it, and paste it somewhere
            to save or edit.
