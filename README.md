# Earfluence Ear Training Tools

I wrote these tools over the course of a few days, based on a similar but worse command line tool that I wrote previously.

After using an app to learn to recognize scale degrees, I hit a plateau when I could reliably recognize the notes of the major scale, but not fast enough to recognize notes in real music without stopping to think about the notes. I wrote the “play a random note, rest” loop to push myself and ratchet my recognition speed faster than what was reasonably possible in the other app. It had a nice side effect of making me also practice reproducing the note on an instrument rather than the app UI. I wanted to make a slightly better version that I could share with people who don't use the command line. So I made this as a quick hobby project.

Try the tools out where I host them on [my web site](https://willghatch.net/earfluence/).
